        - random variable of probabilities
        - how to tell which is better 10k likes and 50 dislikes vs 10 likes 0 dislikes
        - flipping plates game
        - what if we don't know the p of a coin or a plate: say for a weird coin
          - using bayes theorem to calculate posterior when the p of binomial is unknown for a specific number of heads and tails
          - get a proportionality term that can be plotted
        - frequentist vs bayesian
        - KEY1: generalising the above proportionality formula for n+m trials and n heads to get a general formula of binomial with unknown probability
        - the formula uses parameters a for n heads + 1 and b for m tails + 1
        - which is called the Beta Random Variable
        - KEY2: a = wins + 1, b = losses + 1
        - now we have two ways of representing probabilities
          - as a single number / point estimate
          - as a function / distribution
        - KEY3: beta is a distribution for probs. range: [0 to 1]
        - what if the prior in the above plate experiment was beta
          - you get a beta
          - beta is conjugate distribution of beta
        - laplace Smoothing -> Beta(2,2)
        - Uniform -> Beta(1,1)
        - Demo of beta updating with plate flips
        - Example: prior belief of medicine working, converting percentage to beta prior
          - expectation of beta
          - mode of beta
        - how do we compare two beta
        - MAB
        - demo: pokemon drug
        - Optimal decision making
        - Upper confidence bound
        - Thompson Sampling
        - KEY4: The probability density for probablities
        - Any parameter for a "parametrized" random variable can be thought of as a random variable

        - Problem: Number of tries to fill all hash buckets
        - Conditional Expectation
          - Problem: Sum of Dice
          - Key
          - Example: Favourite digit by year at college
          - Example: Units taken by year at college
          - Law of Total Expectation / Law of Iterated Expectation (LIE) / Adam's Rule / Tower Rule / Smoothing Property of Conditional Expectation
